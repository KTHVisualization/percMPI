Notice of changes to the original source
===

The authors of this derivative work, Anke Friederici and Wiebke KÃ¶pp, have adapted and added to the original source in the following ways:
* The cases `iso4096.c` and `isoTest.c` were added, using code from other files of the original source
* The example files (`channel`, `mhd`, `mixing` and `turb`) were removed in their C and Fortran versions
* The Makefile was adapted to mirror these changes
